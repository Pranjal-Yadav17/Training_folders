InputStream :- 
Java FileInputStream class obtains input bytes from a file. It is used for reading byte-oriented data (streams of raw bytes) such as image data, audio, video etc. You can also read character-stream data. But, for reading streams of characters, it is recommended to use FileReader class.

OutputStream:-
Java FileOutputStream is an output stream used for writing data to a file.
If you have to write primitive values into a file, use FileOutputStream class. You can write byte-oriented as well as character-oriented data through FileOutputStream class. But, for character-oriented data, it is preferred to use FileWriter than FileOutputStream.
